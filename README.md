# tetris-plus
Tetris in 4D, written in Python 3

Run main.py to play. Piece syntax instructions can be found in piece_parser.py. There are no requirements.

Controls:
WASD to move forward/back/left/right
QE to move up/down

GHJ are XW/YW/ZW rotations (rotations not in the 4th dimension)
BNM are XY/YZ/XZ rotations (rotations in the 4th dimension)

Every rotation changes coordinates on two axes, meaning each rotation is parallel to the OTHER two axes.
